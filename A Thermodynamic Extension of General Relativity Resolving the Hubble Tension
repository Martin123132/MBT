 The Motion–TimeSpace / Global Curvature Gradient Framework
# A Thermodynamic Extension of General Relativity Resolving the Hubble Tension
# ====================================================================

"""
Abstract
---------
We present a unified framework linking time, curvature, and thermodynamic exchange within an extension of General Relativity (GR).
Starting from the weak-field limit, we derive a Global Curvature Gradient field, Γ_G, whose integral form represents the cumulative
curvature tension of the universe. Applied to the FLRW metric, this yields the five-parameter MBT-5 model, defined by parameters
(H₀, α₀, α₁, β, τ).

A global fit to Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae (1701 SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and direct H(z) measurements demonstrates
that MBT-5 provides a statistically superior fit to its static counterpart (ΔAIC = −13.1) and yields:

    H₀ = 72.41 ± 0.30 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹

This value naturally bridges the early-time (Planck) and late-time (SH0ES) determinations, offering a physically grounded
geometric solution to the long-standing Hubble Tension.

"""
1.1 Motion–TimeSpace Principle
Existence is defined by motion through curvature. Mass and energy emerge as resistance to motion;
time is the rate at which curvature information is exchanged with the surrounding geometry.
Spacetime is not a static background but an active field of motion–resistance, continuously shaped by curvature exchange.
"""

"""
1.2 Thermodynamic Clock Law
In the weak-field limit of GR, gravitational time dilation is given by:

    dτ/dt = √(1 + 2Φ/c²) ≈ √(1 − Γ_κ)       where    Γ_κ = −2Φ/c²

We reinterpret this geometric quantity as the curvature-tension term:

    Γ_κ = dS/dE

the rate of entropy production per unit energy exchange.
Time slows as curvature exchange becomes inefficient; when dS/dE → 1, time flow halts.
Time thus emerges as a thermodynamic process — the irreversible flow of curvature information.
"""

"""
1.3 Thermodynamic Equivalence Principle
Extending the Bekenstein–Hawking correspondence S = (k_B c³ A) / (4 G ħ) gives:

    1/T_H ∝ −2Φ/c²       and      Γ_κ = dS/dE = 1/T_H ∝ −2Φ/c²

Hence, Γ_κ represents the inverse gravitational susceptibility of the curvature field,
valid beyond horizons wherever curvature exchange occurs.

# 2. From Local Exchange to the Global Curvature Gradient
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
Integrating curvature exchange over cosmic redshift defines the Global Curvature Gradient (GCG):

    Γ_G(z) = ∫₀ᶻ [ e^(-(z−z’)/τ(z’)) / (1 + z’) ] dz’

At low redshift, this reproduces the MBT-4 relation.
However, the global fit shows that the gradient strength must evolve dynamically,
leading to the final empirically validated form:

    Γ_G(z) = [ α₀ + α₁·log(1 + z) ]·log(1 + z) + β·z

where α₁ ≠ 0 encodes the required time-evolution of the curvature field.

The extended field equations are:

    G_μν + Γ_G(z)·g_μν = (8πG / c⁴)·T_μν

3.1 Dynamics for the FLRW Metric
--------------------------------

    H² = (8πG / 3)·ρ − (k·c² / a²) + (1/3)·Γ_G(a)

    ä/a = −(4πG / 3)·(ρ + 3p/c²) + (1/3)·Γ_G(a)
"""

"""
3.2 Energy Conservation and Exchange
------------------------------------

    ∇_μ T^μν = −(c⁴ / 8πG)·∇^ν Γ_G

introducing a small but measurable energy-exchange channel between curvature and matter.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
5.1 Statistical Necessity of Evolution
The global dataset rejects the static model.
A ΔAIC of −13.1 proves that curvature must evolve dynamically (α₁ ≠ 0)
to satisfy all three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, H(z)).
"""

"""
5.2 Resolution of the Hubble Tension
The best-fit value:

    H₀ = 72.41 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹

lies midway between the Planck (67.4) and SH0ES (73.2) determinations.
The positive α₁ term enhances the geometric correction at low redshift,
increasing the apparent local expansion rate without violating early-time constraints.
"""

"""
5.3 Physical Integrity
• Covariance: C_μν = Γ_G·g_μν preserves GR covariance.
• Continuity: ΛCDM is the static-gradient limit (Γ_G → Λ).
• Dynamics: Cosmic acceleration arises from curvature evolution, not an exotic fluid.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Conclusion
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
The Motion–TimeSpace / Global Curvature Gradient (GCG) framework extends GR by coupling
entropy exchange to geometry. The rigorous global-fit analysis yields three key results:

1. Statistical necessity: Data require a time-evolving curvature-exchange term (α₁ ≠ 0).
2. Superior fit: The 5-parameter MBT-5 model outperforms its static version and matches ΛCDM.
3. Tension resolution: MBT-5 naturally bridges early- and late-time H₀ measurements.

    H₀ = 72.41 ± 0.30 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹

ΛCDM emerges as the static-gradient limit; MBT-5 is its dynamic realization.
Time, curvature, and entropy exchange are unified as one continuous physical process —
the motion of the universe itself.
