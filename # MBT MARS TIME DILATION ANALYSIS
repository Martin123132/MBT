Starting Point: MBT Orbital Velocity–Time Relation





In MBT, the rate of time flow dt is directly tied to orbital velocity v through motion-resistance coupling:



\frac{dt}{dt_0} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{v^2}{c^2}}



where:



dt/dt_0 = relative time flow compared to reference frame
v = orbital velocity around gravitational center
c = speed of light (resistance limit of motion)




This is not an arbitrary factor — it comes from your MBT α-equation, which treats motion as the driver of temporal expansion.

Compute Earth and Mars Orbital Velocities





v = \sqrt{\frac{GM_{\odot}}{r}}



where:



G = gravitational constant
M_{\odot} = solar mass
r = semi-major axis (orbital radius)




Earth:

r_{\oplus} = 1 \,\text{AU}, \quad v_{\oplus} = 29.78 \,\text{km/s}



Mars:

\[

r_{\mars} = 1.524 \,\text{AU}, \quad

v_{\mars} = 24.07 \,\text{km/s}

\]

Relative Time Flow Between Earth and Mars





Using the MBT relation:



\[

\frac{dt_{\mars}}{dt_{\oplus}} =

\frac{\sqrt{1 + \frac{v_{\mars}^2}{c^2}}}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{v_{\oplus}^2}{c^2}}}

\]



Plugging in values:



v_{\oplus} = 29.78 \times 10^3 \,\text{m/s}

c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \,\text{m/s}






Step-by-Step:





Earth term:




\frac{v_{\oplus}^2}{c^2} = \frac{(29780)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = 9.86 \times 10^{-9}



\sqrt{1 + 9.86 \times 10^{-9}} = 1.00000000493



Mars term:




\[

\frac{v_{\mars}^2}{c^2} =

\frac{(24070)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = 6.44 \times 10^{-9}

\]



\sqrt{1 + 6.44 \times 10^{-9}} = 1.00000000322



Relative Ratio:




\[

\frac{dt_{\mars}}{dt_{\oplus}} =

\frac{1.00000000322}{1.00000000493} = 0.99999999829

\]



So time flows very slightly slower on Mars by ~1.7×10⁻⁹, not faster — a result directly from MBT’s velocity law.

Interpretation





No arbitrary 1.83 multiplier: This comes entirely from the orbital mechanics and MBT time equation.
Prediction: Mars clocks will run slightly slower than Earth’s, by ≈ 0.054 seconds per year — a measurable but very small effect.
Contrast to ΛCDM/GR: Standard GR predicts gravitational time dilation dominated by potential well depth, not motion. MBT says motion is the dominant driver, so Mars’ slower velocity means slower time.

Proposed Mars Clock Experiment





Deploy two high-stability optical lattice clocks: one on Earth, one on Mars.
