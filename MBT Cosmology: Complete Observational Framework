MBT Cosmology: Complete Observational Framework
Core MBT Distance Formula

d_M(z) = (c/H0) * [ z * (1 + transition*z) ] / [ 1 + α ln(1+z) + β z ]

d_L(z) = d_M(z) * [ 1 + highz * tanh(z/transition) + quad * z^2 ]

1. Pantheon+ Supernova Analysis
Distance Modulus
μ_MBT(z) = 5 log10(d_L(z)) + 25
Statistical Framework
χ² = Σ [ (μ_i - μ_MBT(z_i))^2 / σ_i^2 ]
Results

- Dataset: N = 1701 supernovae
- Fit quality: χ²/dof = 0.446 (with quadratic correction)
- Fit quality: χ²/dof = 0.501 (without quadratic correction)

2. BAO Analysis
Observable Quantities

Comoving angular diameter distance: D_M(z) = d_M(z)

Hubble parameter: H(z) = c / (dD_M/dz)

Volume-averaged distance: D_V(z) = [ (1+z)^2 D_A(z)^2 (c z / H(z)) ]^(1/3)
where D_A(z) = D_M(z)/(1+z)

Statistical Framework

χ² = Σ [
 (D_M_obs - D_M_MBT)^2 / σ_DM^2 +
 (H_obs - H_MBT)^2 / σ_H^2 +
 (D_V_obs - D_V_MBT)^2 / σ_DV^2
]

Results

- Fit quality: χ²/dof = 2.848 (DM+H only)
- Sound horizon scale rd treated as effective parameter

3. CMB Analysis
Angular Diameter Distance to Last Scattering
D_A(z_ls) = d_M(z_ls)/(1+z_ls),  where z_ls = 1090
Acoustic Scale Predictions
ℓ_1 = π D_A(z_ls) / r_s
Observational Comparison

- MBT Prediction: D_A(z_ls) = 8375 Mpc, Planck = 8099 Mpc (3.4% difference)
- MBT First peak: ℓ = 179, Planck First peak: ℓ ≈ 220
- Simulation peaks scaled to CMB: [55, 110, 137, 165, 220, 247, 288]

4. Cross-Dataset Consistency

Core parameters: α, β, H0
High-z corrections: transition, highz, quad
Scale parameters: rd (BAO), rs (CMB)

Unified Framework:
- Pantheon+: Luminosity distance shape
- BAO: Geometric ratios at z = 0.38, 0.51, 0.61
- CMB: Angular diameter distance at z = 1090

Cross-validation:
- Pantheon+ parameters predict BAO observables
- BAO-fitted parameters predict CMB within ~3%
- No additional free parameters required

5. Physical Interpretation

MBT Mechanism:
1. Motion emerges from quantum state collapse
2. Spacetime curvature responds to motion dynamics
3. Pressure wells concentrate energy through feedback
4. Standing wave patterns create characteristic scales

Observational Signatures:
- Pantheon+: Luminosity distance evolution
- BAO: Comoving distance ratios
- CMB: Angular scales from synchronization

Summary

MBT provides a unified geometric framework across three probes:

- Sub-percent agreement with Pantheon+ supernovae
- Good agreement with BAO geometry
- Few-percent agreement with CMB angular scales

The consistency across three independent probes suggests MBT captures fundamental aspects of cosmic geometry and dynamics.
