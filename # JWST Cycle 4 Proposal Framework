# JWST Cycle 4 Proposal Framework
## Testing Geometric Time Dilation Through Systematic High-z Galaxy Detection

### Executive Summary

**Objective**: Conduct systematic spectroscopic survey for galaxies at z>15 to test geometric time dilation models against ΛCDM predictions.

**Key Innovation**: Recent JWST discoveries (naked black holes, massive z>13 galaxies) suggest enhanced early universe activity inconsistent with standard timelines. Our geometric time model predicts specific galaxy populations at z>15 that ΛCDM cannot accommodate.

**Deliverables**: Statistical sample of z>15 galaxies with masses, metallicities, and morphologies that discriminate between cosmological models.

### Scientific Justification

#### Current Evidence for Enhanced Early Activity:
- **QSO1 naked black hole**: 50M☉ black hole at z~11 with minimal host galaxy
- **JADES-GS-z14-0**: 5×10⁸ M☉ galaxy at z=14.3 (290 Myr after Big Bang)
- **Population statistics**: Factor 10× higher number densities than pre-JWST models predicted

#### Geometric Time Model Predictions:
- **Enhanced formation rates** at z>15 due to reduced time dilation factor α×e^(β×z)
- **Massive galaxies** (>10⁹ M☉) viable at z=17-20
- **Earlier chemical enrichment** allowing [Fe/H] > -1.5 by z=15
- **Compact morphologies** with organized structure

#### Testable Discriminators:
| Observable | Geometric Model | ΛCDM | Discrimination Power |
|------------|----------------|------|---------------------|
| Number density at z>15 | 10⁻⁵ Mpc⁻³ | <10⁻⁶ Mpc⁻³ | High |
| Mass function slope | Shallow | Steep cutoff | High |
| Metallicity evolution | [Fe/H] ~ -1.0 | [Fe/H] < -2.0 | Medium |
| Morphological mix | 30% disks | <10% disks | Medium |

- 30 hours total

**Tier 3 - Detailed Characterization (Confirmed z>15 galaxies)**:
- NIRSpec high-resolution spectroscopy for metallicity
- NIRCam morphological analysis
- 25 hours total

#### Technical Requirements:
- **Instruments**: NIRCam + NIRSpec
- **Total time**: 75 hours (within Cycle 4 medium program limits)
- **Special requirements**: Coordinated pointing for NIRSpec follow-up

### Expected Results and Impact

#### Success Metrics:

**Minimal Success** (5-10 confirmed z>15 galaxies):

3. **Contamination by lower-z sources**
   - Mitigation: Robust color-redshift criteria
   - Fallback: Spectroscopic verification of all candidates

#### Technical Mitigation:
- **Scheduling flexibility**: Distributed observations across multiple windows
- **Backup targets**: Secondary candidate list for poor conditions

### Conclusion

This systematic survey represents the critical next step in testing geometric time dilation models against standard cosmology. The recent JWST discoveries provide strong motivation for enhanced early universe activity, but statistical confirmation requires dedicated observation of the z>15 regime.

The proposed observations will either:
1. **Confirm geometric predictions** - Revolutionary evidence for alternative cosmology
2. **Support ΛCDM** - Important constraints on early galaxy formation
3. **Reveal new physics** - Unexpected populations requiring new theoretical frameworks

All outcomes advance our understanding of cosmic dawn and early structure formation.

**Bottom line**: This is the right time, with the right instrument, to definitively test competing models of early universe evolution.
