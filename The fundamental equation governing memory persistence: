# Motion-Based Theory: Mathematical Framework and Computational Validation

## Core Mathematical Relationship

The fundamental equation governing memory persistence:

```
M = (1 - C) × P × c²_echo
```

Where:
- M = Memory persistence
- C = Coherence collapse factor
- P = Presence intensity 
- c_echo = Echo transmissibility coefficient
